## üìö Introduction

Cardinal-Anticheat also contains a custom build-in replay system which is quite usable to check whether a player was cheating or not. The output-file is a .zip file ~ 5MB depending on the amount of worlds used and their size.

## üëæ Testserver

If you are interested but don't want to setup a test server to try out the anticheat, you are welcome to join the official public testserver. The server, however, runs minecraft 1.8

### Custom ban manager

By default Cardinal Anticheat doesn't handle a database connection. The reason is farily easy to understand. Cardinal Anticheat is a close source plugin whose source is never on the server physically. This has legitimate security and privacy concerns. 

That's why you can tell cardinal anticheat in the `Config.yml` which commands should be executed in case of a ban etc.

### Built-in ban system

As already stated does Cardinal Anticheat not handle any database connections by default, however using the build-in ban system requires you to use a so called dialect which you have to write yourself. The documentation for writing a dialect is available [here](DIALECT.md).

Due to inquiries I have already written a dialect for the mongo and mysql driver. You can download them [here](dialects/)

### Report system

Maybe you don't want a player to be banned right away or lower the chance of banning a legit player. For this reason it makes sense to use Cardinal's report system. Each flag is saved in the database using a [dialect](DIALECT.md) and based on the number and type of flags, a moderator can decide for himself when a player should be banned. For example you only ban the 10% of players with the most falgs each month etc. Maybe you want to introduce some form of trust factor and scale damage and recoil as a result. You might want to let players with similar trust factors play against each other. If you are a developer and want to get to implement such a system, the possibilities are limitless.

### Addons

Cardinal also allows loading, developing and sharing addons. There are already some addons on my [discord](https://go.lukasl.dev/cacdiscord) server. Furthermore, there is a rather good documentation for developsers on how to write your own addons [here](ADDON.md).
