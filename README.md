Cardinal-Anticheat also contains a custom build-in replay system which is quite usable to check whether a player was cheating or not. The output-file is a .zip file ~ 5MB depending on the amount of worlds used and their size.

## üìù Getting Started

First navigate to the [**release**](https://github.com/Clientastisch/Cardinal-Anticheat/releases) tab and download the newest version available. After the download move the jar file into the plugins folder. Reload your server and you're ready to go.

```

### Custom ban manager

By default Cardinal Anticheat doesn't handle a database connection. The reason is farily easy to understand. Cardinal Anticheat is a close source plugin whose source is never on the server physically. This has legitimate security and privacy concerns. 

That's why you can tell cardinal anticheat in the `Config.yml` which commands should be executed in case of a ban etc.

### Built-in ban system

As already stated does Cardinal Anticheat not handle any database connections by default, however using the build-in ban system requires you to use a so called dialect which you have to write yourself. The documentation for writing a dialect is available [here](DIALECT.md).

Due to inquiries I have already written a dialect for the mongo and mysql driver. You can download them [here](dialects/)

## Troubleshooting

If any bugs or false positives occurre **report** them [**here**](https://github.com/Clientastisch/Cardinal-Anticheat/issues/new/choose). <br>
Otherwise I'll probably never notice them
