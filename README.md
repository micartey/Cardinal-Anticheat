## 📚 Introduction

Cardinal Anticheat is a minecraft anticheat that uses more than a hundred different checks to make players have a hard time hacking into your server. Each check is unique and designed specifically for Cardinal Anticheat. So there are currently no hack clients that can easily bypass Cardinal Anticheat. This offers a great advantage in keeping your server safe from hackers while known anti-cheats can't do the job.

### Motivation

I started making this 4-5 years ago. Since then the project went through several stages and restructure phases. The time spend is not meant to represent any sort of measurement of how good this anticheat is. Nothing is skidded and all checks have been implemented by my own and following my own concepts. This is a key strength compared to other anticheats in terms of bypasses. The 4.X branch is currently a new concept I am trying to improve, thus a lot of checks have not been implemented so far. This project is a fun project to me and I spend time on it when I want to. It also serves as a playground for new things I learn.

### Testserver

Cardinal has a public testserver which is available via the following ip/domain. The server runs on Minecraft 1.8 but newer versions work as well thanks to ViaVersion.

```
cardinal.micartey.dev
```

> In case the server is offline, please join the official discord server and give me a notice that you want to test the anticheat on the testserver.
