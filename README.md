## 📚 Introduction

Cardinal Anticheat is a minecraft anticheat that uses more than a hundred different checks to make players have a hard time hacking into your server. Each check is unique and designed specifically for Cardinal Anticheat. So there are currently no hack clients that can easily bypass Cardinal Anticheat. This offers a great advantage in keeping your server safe from hackers while known anti-cheats can't do the job.
